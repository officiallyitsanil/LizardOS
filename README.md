# LizardOS
A first look at my experimental Operating System project.  LizardOS is an early-stage custom OS concept built from scratch to explore how operating systems handle UI, boot processes, and core system management. This repo includes the initial prototype code along with exported assets (UI elements, resources, and experimental builds).
