# 🦎 LizardOS  

> A first look at my experimental Operating System project.  

LizardOS is an early-stage custom OS concept built from scratch to explore how operating systems handle UI, boot processes, and core system management. This repository contains the **prototype code**, **exported assets**, and a **demo video** that showcases the first version of LizardOS.

## 📽 Demo  
You can watch the first look of **LizardOS** in the included video:  
`/ScreenRecorderProject29.mkv`

## 📂 Repository Contents  
- **`/exported-assets/`** → UI elements, design files, and experimental builds  
- **`ScreenRecorderProject29.mkv`** → Demo video of the OS prototype  
- **Source Code** → Initial implementation of LizardOS core + UI experiments  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap  
- [ ] Improve bootloader design  
- [ ] Add process & memory management  
- [ ] Implement basic filesystem support  
- [ ] Expand UI with interactive components  
- [ ] Build installer and ISO for testing
